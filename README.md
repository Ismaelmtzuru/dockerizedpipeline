🚀 Dockerized Data Pipeline
---
“Building scalable, reproducible, and containerized data ingestion pipelines”

📘 Overview
---
This repository implements a fully containerized data pipeline using Docker — designed for Data Engineers who want to deploy, maintain, and scale data workflows efficiently in modern environments.
The main idea is to encapsulate every stage of the data flow — from ingestion to Parquet storage and transformation (e.g., with PyCOG or similar) — within isolated, reproducible containers.

✅ Why It Matters for Data Engineers
---
Ensures consistent environments (libraries, dependencies, OS) across dev, test, and production.

Simplifies orchestration, deployment, and automation on both on-prem and cloud infrastructures.

Improves reproducibility and auditability — making rollback, versioning, and debugging easier.

Enhances maintainability — each pipeline component can be scaled, monitored, or replaced independently.


🧩 Repository Structure
---
.env
Dockerfile
requirements.txt
4-ingest-data-parquet-pycog.py


.env – Configuration file containing environment variables (e.g., credentials, endpoints, paths).

Dockerfile – Defines the base image and dependencies for the data pipeline.

requirements.txt – Lists all Python libraries required for ingestion, transformation, and storage.

4-ingest-data-parquet-pycog.py – Core ingestion script: reads data, processes it, and writes the output in Parquet format (possibly leveraging PyCOG or similar frameworks).


🏁 Quick Start
---

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Ismaelmtzuru/dockerizedpipeline.git
cd dockerizedpipeline
```

2. Set up the environment variables
Adjust .env according to your environment (data source credentials, storage paths, etc.).

3. Build the Docker image
```
docker build -t dockerized-pipeline:latest .
```

4. Run the ingestion pipeline
```
docker run --rm --env-file .env dockerized-pipeline:latest python 4-ingest-data-parquet-pycog.py
```

5. Validate the output
Check that the ingested data was successfully saved in Parquet format and is ready for downstream consumption (ETL/ELT, BI, ML, etc.).


🧠 Technical Design
---
- 🐳 Dockerization

Uses Docker for environment isolation and reproducibility.

The container includes all dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

Perfectly suited for CI/CD integration, deployment automation, and scalable workflows.

- 🧱 Parquet Format

The pipeline writes output in Apache Parquet, a columnar storage format optimized for analytics.

Enables high compression, schema evolution, and interoperability with Spark, Dask, and other big data frameworks.

- 🐍 Modular Python Architecture

Each processing stage is isolated into dedicated scripts for modularity.

Extensible to add more stages (data cleaning, enrichment, validation, warehouse loading).

Serves as a solid foundation for building end-to-end data pipelines.

- ⚙️ Best Practices

Tag Docker images semantically (v1.0.0, v1.1.0…) for reproducibility and traceability.

Automate builds and deployments using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Airflow.

Implement robust logging and monitoring inside containers (execution time, ingestion stats, error tracking).

Add testing layers – unit tests, integration tests, and data validation after ingestion.

Document your schemas and SLAs to improve handover and maintainability.

- 🔮 Future Enhancements

Integrate Apache Airflow for orchestration and scheduling across multiple containers.

Support multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) with Docker Compose or Kubernetes.

Push Docker images to a private container registry for secure and versioned deployments.

Expand to include streaming ingestion, real-time validation, and data lake / warehouse integration.

Add performance benchmarks and alerting systems for latency or error detection.
